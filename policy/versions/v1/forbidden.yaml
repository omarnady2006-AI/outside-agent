description: >
  The presence of any forbidden column names or value patterns within a candidate dataset 
  constitutes a severe security violation. Such findings trigger an immediate QUARANTINE 
  action for the entire dataset copy to prevent the exposure of credentials or secrets. 
  These violations are strictly categorized as non-fixable by automated processes and 
  require manual security review and remediation at the source.
